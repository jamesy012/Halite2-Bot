Improvments to make:
-	COMMENTS

-	improve logging

-	getting my army killed by one unit at the start
	-	Also while playing, one unit can take my planet (!FIXED - if a new unit is spawned close enough)

-	sometimes when attacking the first planet 2 ships crash into eachother (!FIXED - mostly for when we have 20 undocked units or less)

-	attack near by enemy ships (!DONE)

-	only send enough ships to an area that it needs
	-	say 4 enemys docked to a planet, 3 more enemies nearby that can dock 5, then send (5-4)+(3+1*2) == (dock_Spots-docked)+((enemysNearby-docked+1)*2)

-	look to see if there are more undocked enemies nearby
	-	if there are, flee and call for help

-	after a certain amount of ships, have them always stick in groups of a few
	-	should should mean we would win the small fights more often

-	notice when a planet has lots of enemys near by and send some backup there

-	create a general priority map and ships create their own, then ships look at this to work out where they are needed
	-	docked unit getting attack
	-	friendly has near by enemies
	-	lots of enemies grouped up
	-	a few planets grouped up is better then 1 big planet

-	focus on attacking undocked units first, since they can hurt us

-	if the enemy has lots of units grouped up, dont attack with one unit

-	when docking dont put all the ships in the same area, spread it out alittle

-	When moving ships, check to see if there will be a ship in that location by checking the moves

-	a*

-	Improve Navigation

-	Navigation avoidance, dont bother looking at the MovePoints if that ship is going in the same direction as yours
